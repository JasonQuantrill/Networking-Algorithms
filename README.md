    <h1>How to Use</h1>
    <ol>
      <h3>
        <li>Click Add Node to create a new node in the workspace</li>
        <li>Delete Node remove the selected node</li>
        <li>Click Add Edge and then click 2 nodes to add an edge between them</li>
        <li>Delete Edge removes the selected edge</li>
        <li>Set as Source makes the selected node the source node in the algorithm</li>
        <li>Set as Destination makes the selected node the destination node in the algorithm</li>
        <li>Reset removes path highlighting and de-selects source and destination nodes. In addition, it clears the Algorithm Trace below</li>
        <li>Clear All removes all edges and nodes. It also clears the Algorithm Trace below</li>
        <li>Pick either algorithm from the dropdown menu, press Run, and the shortest path from the source node to the
          destination node will be highlighted in green.</li>
        <br>
        <p>The Algorithm Trace box shows each step of the algorithm</p>
