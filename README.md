How to Use

Click Add Node to create a new node in the workspace
Delete Node remove the selected node
Click Add Edge and then click 2 nodes to add an edge between them
Delete Edge removes the selected edge
Set as Source makes the selected node the source node in the algorithm
Set as Destination makes the selected node the destination node in the algorithm
Reset removes path highlighting and de-selects source and destination nodes. In addition, it clears the Algorithm Trace below
Clear All removes all edges and nodes. It also clears the Algorithm Trace below
Pick either algorithm from the dropdown menu, press Run, and the shortest path from the source node to the destination node will be highlighted in green

The Algorithm Trace box shows each step of the algorithm
